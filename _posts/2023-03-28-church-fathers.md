Our generation has completely lost its mind over sexuality.

Out in the broader culture, year-over-year, we remove boundary after boundary, quickly approaching (if we haven't already) an ethic with no sense of moral compass whatsoever.

## Debating Self-Control On Social Media

Once on Twitter, I argued that Christians ought to rise above most of the foray. Marriage and sex are a temporary arrangement, not to carry over from this life into the world to come.[^1] This echoes something Paul said to the Corinthians:

> For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.
> 
> I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I. ([1 Corinthians 7:7-8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Cor.+7%3A7-8%2C+KJV&version=KJV))

I was accused of "gnosticism."

Grown Christian men seemed to become quite upset at the idea that they should "deny their natural desires."

It's from this point that many churches point to marriage, not self-denial, as the solution for a man's sexual appetites. Indeed, that's exactly the best place for it.

Yet in doing so, Christians in America all too often hold up marriage as <em>the premier cardinal virtue of Christianity</em> in the process.

(Spoiler: It's not. At least it didn't used to be.)

## What Did The First Christians Think?

So I like to turn to Ignatius, one of the early church fathers, witnessing to what the earliest Christians thought about such topics. 

> ... ye virgins, to Christ in purity, not counting marriage an abomination, but desiring that which is better, not for the reproach of wedlock, but for the sake of meditating on the law. (Ignatius, *Epistle to the Philadelphians*, [ch. IV](https://ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.v.vi.iv.html))

> <strong>Virgins, have Christ alone before your eyes, and His Father in your prayers, being enlightened by the Spirit. May I have pleasure in your purity, as that of Elijah, or as of Joshua the son of Nun, as of Melchizedek, or as of Elisha, as of Jeremiah, or as of John the Baptist, as of the beloved disciple, as of Timothy, as of Titus, as of Evodius, as of Clement, who departed this life in [perfect] chastity,</strong> Not, however, that I blame the other blessed [saints] because they entered into the married state, of which I have just spoken. For I pray that, being found worthy of God, I may be found at their feet in the kingdom, as at the feet of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; as of Joseph, and Isaiah, and the rest of the prophets; as of Peter, and Paul, and the rest of the apostles, that were married men. For <strong>they entered into these marriages not for the sake of appetite, but out of regard for the propagation of mankind.</strong> (Ignatius, *Epistle to the Philadelphians*, [ch. IV](https://ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.v.vi.iv.html), emphasis added)

My interlocutors on Twitter would be none to pleased to read that. Christ calls us to quite a high standard, to rise above the demands of our mortal bodies.

> ... reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
>
> Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
>
> Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. ([Romans 6:11-13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+6&version=KJV))

[^1]: Addressing the Jesus, the Pharisees ask him to whom a certain woman will be married to "after the resurrection," to which he replies:

    > Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
    >
    > For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven. ([Mathew 22:29b-30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022&version=KJV))
