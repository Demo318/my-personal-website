Personal branding has become incredibly important. There was a time on the internet when the preferred the preferred medium of communication was through pseudonymous accounts.

Today, the paradigm of the internet has change. No longer are we exchanging just information (esp. information that falls outside of mainstream channels). These days the internet serves for acquiring value. The trove of information has no bottom. The trick is finding something thats useful.

As such, it's important to cut through the clutter of bots, [rent seeking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rentseeking.asp) with virtual real-estate, and find *real people* who are leveraging *real expertise* to provide valuable solutions to the problems we face. To that end, this website will serve as my own repository of such information.

## My Starter Tech Stack

I build this website as I'm currently taking courses to further expand my technical skill set. This will not be a fully featured web application, probably ever, but I hope to still use this space to feature my growing developer vocabulary.

### [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

A powerful tool for building static websites, Jekyll allows me to craft most of my material in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and use the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) template engine behind the scenes to craft the layouts.

### [HTML 5](https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5847/a-marketer-s-guide-to-html5.aspx) & [CSS 3](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/css-tutorial/)

Speed might be one of my highest goals for this site. As such, I don't want to bog down the user experience by requiring each session download a host of frameworks. I'll be crafting this website with a quite minimalist approach, writing just about everything from scratch, forcing me to learn the skills at the same time.

### Javascript

Honestly one of my weakest areas. I'll be learning Javascript anyway, and here I'll implement enough to make the website interesting. Again, one big goal being not to bog down the experience anymore than necessary.

### [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)

Why make a blog if you can't have comments? Instead of developing a [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) application to drive an engine myself, I've implemented Disqus to easily add a comments section anywhere I might like one.

### [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)

Though using my own domain, I'll actually host my content through Github. It's free, and it makes keeping track of both the code and content that much easier.

## Topics I'll Talk About

Because this is my space, I will share thoughts, opinions, and insights on items important to me. In general, I'll likely look at three main topics.

### Code

As I'm continuing my journey as a software developer, this will be a big focus. In many ways, this website will become my own reference material as I continue to grow my own skills in this area.

### Sales

Seemingly without my say-so, I've had decade-long career in technical sales. I hope to deposit some of my learnings here for others to benefit from.

This topic oftentimes overlaps with *Code*, as many smaller tech companies themselves have to become their own sales operations.

### Faith

As a Christian, my religion is very important to me. Have a background in theological education, and I would like to articulate many of those points here on this site.

### Family

As a husband and a father, I likewise have many thoughts here as well. I particularly have in mind other dads of growing families who find themselves at a loss of how to navigate the growing network of relationships in their own house.

## A Long Journey

This site will continue to evolve, both in features and content. It will be interesting to see over the years what transpires and to look back perhaps a decade from now to observe how far things have come.
