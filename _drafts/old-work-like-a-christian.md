How To Work Like A Christian
BY FINAL SIGMA · FEBRUARY 1, 2023

We all have to work. When you’re a child, you have to pick up your room and do your chores. As a student, you have your school work. Into adulthood, you get a j-o-b in addition to the ongoing routines and maintenance for your house. In all of these areas, you wonder what it means to work like a Christian.

No one gets to escape work, but we can use the Bible to inform how we approach our work.


The World’s Way: Buy New Things!
At my job, I’m in commissioned sales. The more you sell, the more money you make. The incentives are aligned, and folks who work hard earn a lot of money.

As such, I’ve often heard managers and leadership praise lifestyles that require a lot of money. Indeed, one manager I had shared that he’s glad he has a hefty car payment on his new pickup truck because it encourages him to work harder!

Sure, let’s admit that this can be a great motivator. When you’ve given yourself more bills to pay, you’ll work hard to get those bills paid. Proverbs says as much:

A worker’s appetite works for him;
his mouth urges him on.

Proverbs 16:26 (ESV)
However, hunger presents quite a different concept than a new truck. For the latter, I think of 1 John:

Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world – the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and the pride of life – is not from the Father but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.

1 John 2:15-17 (ESV)
As a Christian, there are plenty of reasons to be a good worker, but “to buy fancy things” isn’t one of them.

God’s Way: Contentment In Your Obedience
Ecclesiastes presents my favorite thoughts on the banality of life. Here we find the perspective of a man who has tried to find fulfillment in every worldly pleasure, spending more money, enjoying more women, and eating fancier food than the average mortal can conceive of. In every case, he finds them utterly worthless at the end of the day.

So – after exploring everything that doesn’t provide fulfillment – what does?

Work!

But not just any work. It is work with a humble demeanor aimed at pleasing God by doing what is right:

There is nothing better for a person than that he should eat and drink and find enjoyment in his toil. This also, I saw, is from the hand of God, for apart from him who can eat or who can have enjoyment? For to the one who pleases him God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he has given the business of gathering and collecting, only to give to one who pleases God. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.

Ecclesiastes 2:24-26 (ESV)
Indeed he says it again, this time emphasizing that trying to “figure out” God’s plans is a soul-crushing waste of time. We ought to be happy with the work God has placed in front of us:

What gain has the worker from his toil? I have seen the business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with. He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man’s heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end. I perceived that there is nothing better for them than to be joyful and to do good as long as they live; also that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil – this is God’s gift to man.

Ecclesiastes 3:9-13 (ESV)
Here again, with an eye to taking along a wife in this short life that we live:

Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life that he has given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun. Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might, for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.

Ecclesiastes 9:9-10 (ESV)
Finally, in closing out his message, The Preacher closes with his most important point:

The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. For God will bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good or evil.

Ecclesiastes 12:13-14 (ESV)

Work Like A Christian
I recall once Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear teased one of his guests, “So what’s it like driving like a Christian? Letting people go on ahead of you all the time? It’s a wonder you actually get anywhere!”

It’s a point well taken. Christians should live their lives with practices and motivations that are quite different from the world’s.

Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.

Colossians 3:23-24 (ESV)
I pray that might help you even in today’s assignments.
