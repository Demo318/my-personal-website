I recently went down the rabbit hole of the King James Only controversy. There’s a growing community of Christians who believe the King James version of the Bible is the only accurate translation. In my inquiry, I expected to hear their arguments and find them easily debunkable. After all, I have a college degree in Theology. Surely there’s no argument they have to bring to the table that I haven’t heard already.


Should you watch that documentary, you’ll hear their arguments. They are not what I expected to hear. Indeed, the underlying principle – that the Christian Church has never been without God’s Word – resonates with me very deeply.

Indeed, I take it a step further, arguing that God’s Word alongside God’s prescribed pattern of life and worship has been maintained throughout the generations. In that documentary you’ll heard that for the New Testament, the King James translators used the Greek text as it had been handed down and preserved by the Eastern/Greek Orthodox Church.

What if it was not only the text of Scripture they faithfully preserved since the days of the Apostles?

Only Holy Men Can Prophesy
As I learn more about the Orthodox Church, I’m finding a long track record of monks, priests, and saints who – having given themselves to a life ascetism and prayer – participate in the life of the Holy Spirit as we read about in Scripture.

For example, St. Paisios on multiple occasions had moments of divine knowledge. Indeed, on one car ride he surprised the driver, saying, “Stop! Turn around! There’s a couple in a house back there who is arguing right now, and if we don’t intervene their family will fall apart.” The driver followed his directions to the home, they found a married couple mid-argument, and St. Paisios was given the exact words of wisdom needed for their immediate situation.


Again, this isn’t a one-off event. Reading the lives of Eastern Orthodox saints, you’ll find stories like these over and over again.

In The Bible
Surprisingly, this reality immediately plays out in the argument in favor of the King James Version of the Bible, at least in one passage.

… knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone’s own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

2 Peter 1:20-21 (ESV)
Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.

For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

2 Peter 1:20-21 (KJV, emphasis added)
Considering these verse, I think these differences present a remarkable difference.

Reading the ESV, we get the idea that God – for whatever reason – speaks through some and not others to provide his message. As I think about it, this might be why we Protestants believe Solomon provided us a portion of our Bible – at least Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon – while he himself might have been unregenerate. For instance, it’s often debated whether or not we’ll meet Solomon in heaven.

The KJV on the other hand provides a presupposition of those God chooses. They are holy. When we read that Moses wrote the Pentateuch, we should assume Moses was a holy man. When we find David writing the Psalms, we should assume he lived a life marked by holiness (not suspecting that his love for Jonathan constituted homosexuality).

Holy Men Today
As I learn more about Orthodoxy, the church has placed a premium on leading a holy life. Priests and elders especially must do so.

Further, the message remains consistent that God would work through the holiest men to speak to his people. If you’re in the Orthodox Church, you’ll recognize that priests and monks still make prophecies today.


Additionally, let’s reconsider Paul’s meaning in 1 Corinthians 14:5, where he says:

I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.

1 Corinthians 14:5 (KJV)
Paul taught Timothy that only holy men prophesy. It follows that if we are all to prophesy, perhaps we first need to live lives of holiness. Indeed, this would be obvious to us, if we were reading the King James Version of the Bible.
