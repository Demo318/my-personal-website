What To Do When You Don’t Know What To Do
BY FINAL SIGMA · FEBRUARY 14, 2023

We’ve all been in that conundrum. Life has thrown a significant fork in our path, and now you don’t know what to do. The way forward is not so obvious. Perhaps an important relationship has grown tight with tension, or things at work are not as they seem. It happens to all of us, that there are times when we ourselves can’t see the next step.

If we want to know the answer, we need to properly understand the problem. When we face situations like these, we lack one thing: wisdom.

King Solomon Always Knew What To Do
Early in King Solomon’s reign, God gave him a blessing. He told him, “Ask what I shall give you” (1 Kings 3:5) – a blank check for the new king to acquire whatever he wanted.

Instead of long life, riches, or the defeat of his enemies, Solomon said:

Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, that I may discern between good and evil, for who is able to govern this your great people?

1 Kings 3:9 (ESV)
This pleased the Lord, and he answered:

Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you.

1 Kings 3:12 (ESV)
In the chapters that follow, we read of situation after situation wherein, though perplexing to the rulers and officials around him, Solomon knew precisely the right thing to do, so resolve the situation and to act with justice.

How To Acquire Wisdom
What should you do when you don’t know what to do? You might expect an answer like, “Read your Bible more.” Indeed, reading the Bible will help, but it is in reading the Bible we learn that the answer is not to read the Bible.

In James, the first of the New Testament books to have been written, we get our answer:

If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.

James 1:5 (ESV)

God Gives What?
Too often when we think of prayer, we think of God’s providing us material things. A new car, a new job, a new house, or even a new friend group – when we face challenges we ask God to change things around us so as to resolve our challenges.

But no, in this passage we read that God gives wisdom. If believers would pray to him and ask for it, he would give us the knowledge and the insight to know how we ought to proceed in light of our circumstances.

He provides not external material but internal insight. He does not change them; God changes us.

On One Condition
Here in the same passage, James tells us why God would withhold this wisdom, even if one should ask for it:

But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything form the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.

James 1:6-7 (ESV)
You can imagine someone praying, asking God how to resolve a problem in a friendship. The conflict has festered for a long time, and he doesn’t know what to do.

He prays his prayer, but while he’s praying he – in the back of his mind – makes backup plans. He doesn’t really believe God will provide the answer, so he intends to do a bit of gossiping to acquire the advice of a third party, thinking it might be “helpful.”

This person is doubting. This person is asking without faith. While he believes there’s a chance that God will provide resolution (though making backup plans, just in case), he should believe that God certainly will not provide a resolution because he has a heart that seeks an alternative option.

Saul Was Double-Minded
Solomon’s predecessor King Saul provides an example of such double-mindedness. As the Philistines amass a huge army, striking terror into Israelites everywhere, Saul gathers his own army in Gilgal, preparing to retaliate.

Saul knows that he dare not try to fight a battle without first seeking God’s blessing. Who is to conduct the sacrifice so as to provide the blessing? That would be Samuel, the priest. So he waits.

But he grows impatient. Instead of continuing to wait for Samuel, Saul conducts the sacrifice himself, taking matters into his own hands. Samuel arrives shortly thereafter, and Saul tries to explain himself:

When I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines had mustered at Michmash, I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of the Lord.’ So I forced myself, and offered the burnt offering.’

1 Samuel 13:11-12
Samuel tells Saul what James would tell the double-minded man:

You have done foolishly. You have not kept the command of the Lord your God, with which he commanded you. For then the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever. But now your kingdom shall not continue. The Lord has sought out a man after his own heart, and the Lord has commanded him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept what the Lord commanded you.

1 Samuel 13:13-14
Saul already knew how God was to provide for him. However, acting in his faithlessness, the entire kingdom was torn from his grasp. Saul “should not have supposed to receive anything from the Lord,” as James tells us.

What Are You Really Asking For?
On the surface, it seems like you would be asking for the “answer” to your particular “problem.”

But you’d be wrong. You’re asking for “wisdom.”

So what (or who) is “wisdom”?
The Lord possessed me [wisdom] at the beginning of his work,
the first of his acts of old.
Ages ago I was set up,
at the first, before the beginning of the earth.
When there were no depths I was brought forth,
when there were no springs abounding with water.
Before the mountains had been shaped,
before the hills, I was brought forth,
before he had made the earth with its fields,
or the first of the dust of the world.
When he established the heavens, I was there;
when he drew a circle on the face of the deep,
when he made firm the skies above,
when he established the fountains of the deep,
when he assigned to the sea its limit,
so that the waters might not transgress his command,
when he marked out the foundations of the earth,
then I was beside him, like a master workman,
and I was daily his delight,
rejoicing before him always,
rejoicing in his inhabited world
and delighting in the children of man.

Proverbs 8:22-31 (ESV)
Well that’s interesting. This takes us all the way back to the beginning of creation. Who was present for that?

In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.

Genesis 1:1-2 (ESV, emphasis added)
How on earth does it make any sense at all that when I ask for “wisdom,” God sends his Spirit?

For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. For who knows a person’s thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.

1 Corinthians 2:10b-11 (ESV)

When You Don’t Know What To Do
So, the next time you’re facing a hard thing in life, know that God has the answers. In his answer to your prayer, he does not provide a to-do list, he provided his Spirit who will plumb the depths of God’s incomprehensible knowledge to guide you through to the solution.
