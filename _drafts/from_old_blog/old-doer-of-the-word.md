How To Be A “Doer Of The Word”
BY FINAL SIGMA · FEBRUARY 17, 2023

Throughout James, we hear of a Christian’s relationship with “the word.” We receive it, and then we are to do it. What does that mean? How exactly would one know that he is a “doer of the word”?

What It Is & What It Isn’t
Before delving deeper into how someone might “do” the word, it’s important to understand what “the word” even is. James introduces “the word” in the first chapter of his letter:

Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; for the anger of man does not product the righteousness of God. Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.

James 1:19-21 (ESV), emphasis added
This passage immediately follows a passage on what to do if one “lacks wisdom.” As I’ve discussed elsewhere, when we don’t know what we ought to do in a situation, James teaches us to ask God. Then it is God, by providing us a greater measure of the Holy Spirit, who becomes our wisdom to address whatever lies before us.

It seems that “the implanted word” might be the provision of the “wisdom” that was lacking. You had been facing a challenge (potentially within the church, among Christian brothers and sisters). You prayed to God for wisdom as to how to proceed. He provided that wisdom, namely, “the implanted word.”

Put Off Your Sins
As I read the passage, I suspect that God’s answer to our problems seems counterintuitive to the our fleshly solutions. “The implanted word” here is opposed to “filthiness and rampant wickedness.” The discourse here mirrors Galatians 5:16-26, where continuing on in the sins of our flesh will put us in opposition to the influence of the Holy Spirit.

Explicitly in James 1:20, we read that “anger” itself likewise stands in the way of accomplishing the will of God. Setting aside our pride and willingly clothing ourselves with “meekness” (v. 21) are two prerequisites to enjoying God’s wisdom in light of a difficult situation.

“Hearer of the Word” vs. “Doer of the Word”
At this point, we come to a crossroad. We have received the word in our hearts, God’s wisdom as it applies to the problem that’s in front of us, and now we get to respond. James continues:

But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror. For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like. But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.

James 1:22-25 (ESV)
Having been given our marching orders, the wisdom that we asked for, we face the choice to act or to think.

The Hearer
When we read the text, clearly no one wants to be the hearer, but we’ll still be tempted. It’s so much easier to hear the word instead of doing it. What can we learn about the hearer-only from the text?

Increased Self-Awareness
In the English, we translate the text as, “a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror” (v. 23). As I review the Greek, I might render it “the face he was born with.” In my mind, this means a clear picture of his natural self. The old man. The sinful man. That unconverted heathen person we are or would have been outside of the transforming grace of God.

When we hear the divine wisdom of God, we feel the stark contrast to our own, short-sighted human wisdom. Indeed, such perception can be gratifying in itself. The hearer might feel a sense of accomplishment, seemingly having made a breakthrough in his spiritual journey.

He Talks Too Much
Perhaps because of this new revelation, he wants to share what he’s learned. He has no intention to make any tangible changes based on what God has revealed to him (see v. 24), but he would like to share.

Indeed this resonates with James’ admonishment in v. 19, where he says, “… let every person be quick to hear and slow to speak …” (emphasis added). Then in v. 26 we learn this person “thinks he is religious” but also “fails to bridle his tongue.”

Though he believes he’s doing a great good (as I might believe simply in writing his blog), his great use of words constitutes the means through which he deceives himself. While he obtains the feeling of obedience, he actually is quite disobedient.

Judging & Teaching
The hearer-only adopts a posture of “I know better.” We see this as James revisits this conflict between hearing and doing in later passages:

Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge. There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?”

James 4:11-12 (ESV)
Instead of pursuing reconciliation with a fellow believer, implementing whatever course of action God has communicated by the Holy Spirit, this hearer has decided he knows better! In chapter one, James connects hearing-only with a lack of self-control in one’s speech. Here he makes the same connection in speaking evil and judging when he should be doing. This person takes matters into his own hands and presses the conflict further.

There’s a similar parallel when James addresses teaching:

Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. For we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body. If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well. Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs. So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things.

How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire!

James 3:1-5 (ESV)
Having received some wisdom or insight from God, one might feel inclined to teach. James shares that the more difficult – and more spiritually profitable – course of action is to keep one’s own mouth quiet and obey the word which has been given.

The Doer
Of the two options, being a doer of the word requires much more effort than being a hearer-only.

Action
The first note, as I read the text, is the doer of the word responds by taking action. Instead of considering what he might say, instead of joining simply writing a host of blog posts (like this!), he creates a to-do list.

… being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.

James 1:25b (ESV)
When I worked in management, my team members would approach me with problems they’d uncovered. Oftentimes as we talked, we would cross a threshold where it became clear that we had talked for too long.

Certainly in spiritual matters, there are words to be exchanged, but there’s a clear demarcation between talk that leads to action and talk that serves as a substitute for action.

Perseverance
There’s a lesson to be learned from video games: If you keep running into bad guys, that means you’re going the right way. Very similar to the person doing the word:

But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres ….

James 1:25a (ESV) emphasis added
Just a few verses earlier, James tells us about this perseverance:

Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.

James 1:2-3 (ESV)
Do you find yourself lacking in “trials of various kinds”? Action will invite trials which require perseverance. Sitting and talking requires nothing.

Given to Service
To hammer home the idea that sitting around and talking about “the word” does not constitute Christianity, James emphasizes:

If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person’s religion is worthless. Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.

James 1:26-27 (ESV) emphasis added
Being a doer of the word will cost us something. At least our time, but also our resources and reputation. Job, a prime example of “pure and undefiled” religion, went out of his way to defend the poor and the orphans, perhaps even in civil courts (according to some scholars).

When the ear hear it, it called me blessed,
and when the eye saw, it approved.
because I delivered the poor who cried for help,
and the fatherless who had none to help him.
The blessing of him who was about to perish came upon me,
and I caused the widow‘s heart to sing for joy.
I put on righteousness, and it clothed me;
my justice was like a robe and a turban.

Job 29:11-14 (ESV) emphasis added
When we read Job, we see a man held in derision by his “friends,” who have plenty to say but no deeds of service to call their own. James calls us to imitate job, and to be wary of becoming like his friends.

Innocent of Worldliness
In the same passage, James observes a second point about those doers of the word:

Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.

James 1:27 (ESV) emphasis added
In the American church today, it has becoming exceedingly rare to encounter people who are “unstained from the world.” In generations past, the world was “out there,” and within one’s own home you might cultivate a more godly way of life.

Now, the world presents itself inside of our homes on our computers and televisions. Additionally, we each likely have the world reaching out to us in our pockets. The smartphone is a little portal into the broader, godless society.

It often pains me to see Christian leaders, even from highly conservative traditions, touch on the plethora of movies and TV shows they’re watching. The dialogue seems to assume these things are spiritually neutral.

In my opinion, spiritual neutrality doesn’t exist. Either something is of the world (and therefore of the god of this world) or it is of the Holy Spirit (and therefore bringing glory to Christ).

The doer of the word takes such distinctions seriously.

An Example Of A Doer
Saint Nektarios was fraught with false accusations throughout his life. However, he himself remained committed to doing the work God had called him to instead of expending his words. A great example to all of us in this area.


A Doer of the Word In Our Own Stations
James calls every Christian to be a doer of the word. And every Christian, in his or her own unique context, will find their doing manifest quite differently.

In your prayers, in your study of Scripture, and in your worship of Jesus, may your heart be sensitive to the Holy Spirit. Further, my you take action as he provides you spiritual insight as to how you specifically might serve in God’s kingdom.
