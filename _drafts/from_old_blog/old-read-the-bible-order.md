What Order Should I Read The Books of the Bible?
BY FINAL SIGMA · JANUARY 24, 2023

A simple question everyone asks when they think about reading all the books of the Bible for the first time: Where do I start?

Or if you’ve been a Christian for a long time already, you might instead ask: Where do I restart?

Though you and I can walk into a book store and pick up a full Bible, all sixty-six books packaged up nicely for us, God did not deliver them that way. Its authors put pen to papyrus in a particular order, and I believe we can gain a lot by following their lead.

The Chronicles of Narnia
C.S. Lewis’s famous series faces the same conundrum: Should one read them in the order of the events in the story or in the order they were published?

For example, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was published first, but in the whole collection it’s considered book number two. The events of The Magician’s Nephew occur before any of the other books, but it was published sixth out of the seven volumes. Here are our options:

The Wrong Way: Chronological Order
The Magician’s Nephew (1955 – #1)
The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (1950 – #2)
The Horse and His Boy (1954 – #3)
Prince Caspian (1951 – #4)
The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (1952 – #5)
The Silver Chair (1953 – #6)
The Last Battle (1956 – #7)
Though reading through this order events will happen one after the other, you will still be presented with knowledge gaps as you begin. As you read The Magician’s Nephew, you might assume that Lewis builds for you the apparatus you’ll need to understand the rest of his mythical world, but you would be wrong. He already did that in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe which his original audience would have read five years earlier.

The Right Way: Publication Order
The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe (1950 – #2)
Prince Caspian (1951 – #4)
The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (1952 – #5)
The Silver Chair (1953 – #6)
The Horse and His Boy (1954 – #3)
The Magician’s Nephew (1955 – #1)
The Last Battle (1956 – #7)
In this case, you will comprehend each component of the Lewis’s story and the world in which it takes place in the order the author intended. Behind the story, you will learn the facts Narnia. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe will provide an education in Narnia 101. Prince Caspian will build upon it with lessons of Narnia 102. Each in turn moves the narrative forward while also building upon the logical framework you the reader will need to properly understand the content.

In this way, in order to understand book #3 The Horse and His Boy, you will need to have already read The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, and The Silver Chair. With those prerequisites you won’t catch the full message C.S. Lewis intended to convey.

The Order of Biblical Revelation
You might say that God published the books of the Bible in a particular order as well. For example, if you lived as an Israelite in 1370 B.C., your Bible likely only contained Job, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, and a small portion of Psalms. If instead you happened to live as an Israelite closer to 700 B.C., you would have nearly half of our Old Testament available to you.

The New Testament books were written in a particular order as well. I love reading James, because it was likely the earliest written Christian document we have in our Bible. I consider James to be Christianity 101. The issues addressed pertain to the earliest of the early church. We as Christians living much, much later would do well to ensure we learn the lessons contained therein before proceeding to “more difficult” topics.
