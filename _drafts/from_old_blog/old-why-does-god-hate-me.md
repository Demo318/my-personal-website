Why Does God Hate Me?
BY FINAL SIGMA · SEPTEMBER 30, 2022

Everyone suffers through difficult seasons of life. I have yet to meet a single person who doesn’t have a long, hard piece of their life story. Indeed, as you think of God’s sovereignty, you grasp that your hardships are his fault. It’s tempting to ask, “Why does God hate me?” However, as we see in the book of James, we’re approaching the subject with a wrong perspective.

When we ask, “Does God hate me?” we miss the design and purpose in our suffering. God doesn’t hate us. God tests our faith through challenging circumstances. If we remain steadfast in him, we come out even more deeply faithful. If we abandon ship, we prove we didn’t have true faith to begin with.

Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness.

James 1:2-3 ESV
Will You Pass The Test?
In verse 2 of James 1, we read “trials of various kinds.” In verse 3, James chooses to refer to our suffering through these trials as “testing of your faith.”

In the Greek, the word translated testing is δοκίμιον. The test in view does not evaluate strength. The one suffering through the trial isn’t working to discover if he has A+ faith or C- faith. This test is about genuineness, like evaluating whether you’re holding real gold or fool’s gold.

The same word also appears in 1 Peter:

In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness (δοκίμιον) of your faith – more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested (δοκιμαζομένου) by fire – may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ

1 Peter 1:6-7 ESV
Peter emphasizes the precious-metals metaphor even more deeply, adding that true faith that perseveres through these trials is much more valuable than gold. This is not a test to receive a letter grade. This test is pass/fail.

What Constitutes A “Trial”?
Both Peter and James use similar language: “various trials” and “trials of various kinds.

At the end of the day, we cannot predict exactly what kind of trial we might face. We might suffer illness. A loved one might pass away. Our friends could abandon us. Opportunities for sin might cross our path. We may even face direct persecution.

Scripture doesn’t put any restrictions on what might befall us. When we find ourselves in the midst of suffering, tempted to ask, “Why does God hate me?” we ought to remember his design for hard circumstances is good, even if when it doesn’t feel good.

What’s The Point Of My Trials?
Steadfastness.

In his design, suffering yields one of two results.

For some, suffering becomes a reason not to believe in Jesus any longer. The road is too hard. He has taken too much. His rules are too restrictive. Suffering becomes a reason to abandon the faith altogether, used as proof-positive that God isn’t who the Bible says he is.

For others, though, trials comes to a very different conclusion:

And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.

James 1:4 ESV
Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him.

James 1:12 ESV
The self-help gurus tell us “perfection” is found in having the right habits. Modern media informs us that to “lack nothing,” we need a very well put together financial plan or to win the lottery.

God’s logic comes from a different direction. To move closer to perfection, completion, and to lack nothing – to “receive the crown of life” – we must remain faithful to him through trials.


What If God Won’t Give Me What I Need?
“Lacking nothing” of James 1:4 sounds like a tall order. Certainly we’ve all experienced trials, we’ve prayed, and it still seems like God withholds what we need to get through the trial faster.

In James, we read of two reasons why God would not answer our prayers, even under these circumstances.

Reason #1: We’re Not Really Trusting Him
If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God …. But let him ask in faith, with no doubting …. For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord ….

James 1:5-6 ESV
When you pray, do you really believe God will provide the way through? Or do you pray and then scour the internet for secular advice to try first?

As far as James seems to tell us, God withholds his perfect wisdom unless we forsake the worldly, godless advice we might find elsewhere. God patiently waits until circumstances are such that we’re positioned only to say, “God provided this for me.”

Reason #2: We Want To Exercise Our Sinful Passions
You ask and you do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions.

James 4:3
What did Jesus pray for? Did God ever not give him what he asked for?

So often we ask for things which we should not ask for, because we speak from a place of sin – evil in our hearts that we have yet to repent of. We people are little self-deception machines. To hold onto our sin, we’ll do whatever mental gymnastics are necessary.

God’s desire for us is to be holy, conformed to the image of his Son, perfect like Jesus. To that end, he will not provide us anything we ask for, when underneath our asking, sin lurks around for an opportunity. In this case, it is actually his grace to withhold our requests, even if it doesn’t feel like it.

So, Does God Hate Me?
As far as James is concerned, that’s the wrong question. The design in suffering is not to determine how God feels about you, but to reveal how you feel about God. Is your faith genuine? Are you prepared to repent from your sins to step into a deeper holiness?

Suffering – however it manifests – happens God’s tool to draw that out. When it comes your way, you can grumble and complain as so many other have, or you can remember God’s purpose in it and therefore “count it all joy” just as James teaches us.
